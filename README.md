---

GoArtDrawer is a Golang-based project designed to unleash your creativity by providing a simple yet powerful tool for drawing various shapes on the screen. The primary goal of this project is to empower users to visualize their ideas through the creation of rectangles, circles, and triangles, all while enjoying the flexibility of color customization.

Key Features:

3. Screen Rendering: The program provides real-time rendering of your creations on the screen, allowing you to witness the evolution of your artwork. As you draw, modify, and refine shapes, the screen reflects your changes instantly, providing an interactive and dynamic drawing experience.

4. Save as .ppm: Capture your artistic expressions by saving your creations as .ppm files. Whether you're creating digital art, visualizing algorithms, or experimenting with shapes, the ability to save your work ensures that you can revisit and share your masterpieces with ease.

5. User-Friendly Interface: GoArtDrawer prioritizes a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to artists and programmers alike. The intuitive design ensures that you can seamlessly navigate through the program's features, focusing on unleashing your creativity rather than grappling with complex controls.
